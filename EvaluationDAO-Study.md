### Title of Grant Submission
Informing the Future of Open Source Economics in Gno.land

### Grant Type
Tinker

### Description
The proposal aims at:
- Delivering a comprehensive study to explore and establish effective economic models for rewarding contributions in open source software, specifically tailored for the Gno.land ecosystem.
- Engaging with Gno.land extended team & actively contributing to the current research on governance and DAO/subDAO organizational design.

The study will review past experiments in the evaluation of work contributions in DAOs and open source software in order to provide structured knowledge to inform the design of Gno.land's Evaluation DAO.

The study's precise scope will be adjusted at the start of the project. Here are the main aspects that we suggest to cover:

**1. High-level Analysis on Contribution Rewards**

Goal: Providing a general understanding of motives, expectations, and threats related to work incentives in decentralized settings.

Exploring the reasons for distributing rewards to open source developers and contributors in crypto-networks. This will include the adverse effects of contributor's incentives, which can impact recipients' motivations, credible neutrality, or the perception of fairness of the system.

**2. Economics of Contribution**

Goal: Providing an analysis of the main economic models for sourcing and distributing economic value to work contributors in decentralized settings.

Analysis of various funding sources, including token issuance, buyback and earn schemes, community donations, transaction fees, and external sponsorships.
Analysis distribution targets, including individuals, teams, and addresses.
Exploring single vs. dual token models for rewarding contributions.

**3. Evaluation Methodologies**

Goal: Reviewing potential and pitfalls of existing contribution evaluation methodologies in decentralized settings.

Review of specific approaches and challenges associated to different types of contribution.
Comparison of subjective vs. objective evaluation methods.
Comparison of centralized vs. decentralized evaluation processes.
Analysis of evaluation processes of code dependencies.
Case studies of existing DAOs and open source projects to understand their evaluation mechanisms.


### Goal/Purpose
The goal is to offer insights, guidelines, and active engagement that can help Gno.land create a fair and effective system for recognizing and rewarding contributions.


### Background
PhilH is active in the DAO space since 2015, as a founder, contributor, advisor, public speaker and writer. His main interests are decentralized governance and commons-based peer production in crypto-networks. He's been working on projects dedicated to DAO tooling, decentralized finance, and work collectives.

He's currently the Governance Lead at Mangrove DAO, where he designed:
- a novel governance model based on multi-stakeholder power distribution,
- a developer incentives program based on on-chain tracking of developers' contributions.

In addition to the core work conducted by PhilH, the study may occasionally draw on the expertise of Daniel Ospina, former Governance Lead at Aragon and instigator of RnDAO, a research group and venture studio dedicated to a decentralized future of work. Daniel's unique experience and industry knowledge will complement PhilH's expertise in the exploration and review phases of the study.

### Milestones and Overall Time Frame

This sort of study can be open-ended. We suggest to stick to a short timeframe for the initial version, so that its preliminary results can be quickly leveraged in order to adjust the current rewards mechanisms.

Assuming no extension of scope, the timeframe for the initial delivery is projected to be 2 to 3 months max, divided into 4 phases:
- Phase 1: Launch and agreement on the scope of the study
- Phase 2: Exploring and collecting material from papers and interviews with subject matter experts (up to 5)
- Phase 3: Compilation, synthesis, drafting of the study
- Phase 4: Review and revision

Regular updates will be arranged at any frequency Gno.land core team may see fit.
The active participation of representative of Gno.land core team/DAOs is expected, especially in Phase 1 & 3.

### Idea for Fair Funding

We expect the total effort of the study to represent between 20 and 35 man-days of work over 2 to 3 months, plus up to 5 days of complementary review with RnDAO.
The direct engagement with Gno.land team with respect to governance and DAO design is expected to take 1 day per week in average. That will be adjusted depending on the needs of Gno.land and our actual availability. Any adjustment will be submitted and formally agreed before being billed.
We expect funding at a normal daily rate for senior/expert resources (1kâ‚¬ daily rate).

### Contribution to Gno.land
Helping Gno.land to build a more effective contributive economy and governance design for its ecosystem.
