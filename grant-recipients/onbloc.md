## Why are you best suited/what is your background (or teamâ€™s if applicable) (applies to all submissions)?
- Our members bring professional experiences from diverse backgrounds in the blockchain industry including crypto projects, crypto exchanges, consulting firms, incubators, and infosec institutes, with an average career of 6+ years.
- Four of our members were 3-year associates in past companies responsible for service planning, development, and operations, which is why Onbloc was able to deliver a series of products in such a short period of time.
- Each of our members is committed to continuously improving the UI/UX of our products. We believe that quality interfaces are essential for basic infrastructure services such as wallets and decentralized exchanges for mass adoption of Web3.
- Our members have gathered with a strictly aligned vision of building a suite of streamlined products to contribute to the development of the Gnoland ecosystem. Our workflow is optimized for each member to work as efficiently as possible to make the most out of a small, focused team.

### Your idea for fair funding of the proposal
- For the aforementioned purposes, we request a total grant of $600,000 USD.
- We propose the grant to be distributed in three multiple batches of even sizes.
    - Batch 1: Upon the approval of the grant.
    - Batch 2: â‰ˆ50% of all tasks, â‰ˆ50% of Gno Core tasks complete and reviewed by the core team.
    - Batch 3: â‰ˆ95% of all tasks, â‰ˆ95% of Gno Core tasks complete and reviewed by the core team.
- For Batch 2 and 3, we will present our deliverables to the core team and request for a thorough review. All of the deliverables will be submitted either on-chain or on Github for transparency and auditability. We want the Gnoland ecosystem to benefit from the grant we receive from this funding, hence the reason we will open source all of our source code included in the scope of this proposal.
- An update will be made to this PR once per month as a periodic report.

### What do you and the submission bring to the Gno.land platform and community?
- Contribute to completing the essential features in Gno Core that the Gnoland blockchain needs for mainnet.
- Provide quality and production-level infrastructure tools (wallet, explorer, dex), which are essential for each blockchain ecosystem, for users and developers for testnets and upon the mainnet launch.
- Bring Gnoswap, a dex with a suite of customizable exchange solutions powered by its liquidity that will test the scalability and performance of Gno.land to its limits.
Contribute to the Gno Core to accelerate the mainnet launch.
- Integrate the newest functions of Gno.land as the first tester to improve/develop the missing parts.
- Provide the best onboarding environment for other Gnolang/dapp developers.
