### The title of your grant submission (how do you want us to remember you ðŸ˜Š)
Malek (Rouen Students) Contribution

### A short description of what you are proposing (applies to all submissions)
I want to continue developing the GnoFundMe project and make it an official Gno ecosystem project. I want to contribute to Gnoland project by developing/adding Realms and packages useful for the ecosystem, specializing in anything where I can be helpful (front, data, maybe a gno testify pkg). Additionally, I aim to develop a [GnoPool](https://hackmd.io/JRatkf0wQ_uYB5G2wNvRRw) BootCamp in collaboration with the teams in Rouen to enable as many people as possible to learn Gno quickly and efficiently. I also plan to try to attract new talents from Tunisia and maybe other countries to enrich gno contributions program.

### What is the goal or the purpose of the proposed grant? (applies to all submissions)
The purpose of this grant is to continue after the positive experience I had during the internship, and dedicate my full time to Gno, contributing to its rapid development. Additionally, it will support other developers in learning Gno through the GnoPool BootCamp.

### Contributions, issues and pull requests made to Gno and Game of Realms (links please)
My first contribution was an update to the docs [1712](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/pull/1712), after that *"todolist"* example [1811](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/pull/1811), when testing it we noticed with Manfred a problem with ufmt, so I added another PR [1889](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/pull/1889). Other PRs and issues came later. We helped a lot through feedback and curiosity questions.
Here's my github: [**Malek**](*https://github.com/MalekLahbib*).

#### GnoFundME
This my last contribution, that is still a work in progress, [GnoFundMe](https://github.com/MalekLahbib/gnofundme), a crowdfunding platform that uses the gno.land blockchain.
#### Future
I'm trying always to be curious by looking each time to the new merged PRs to understand what's happening, and learn more about the project. I want to contribute more to the core project, I don't have a clear area of specialization in y head and can adapt to what needed.
I hope to introduce this project to some developers/schools in my home country Tunisia.

**Community Engagement:**
    * Organized an open-source conference with Manfred and Web3Normandy to Zone01 students and showcased our exciting work by discussing our student program and Gnoland with potential contributors through organized events.
### Why are you best suited/what is your background for the team to review your profile
During the internship, I used my knowledge and my curiosity to dive into documentation, than into some apps (gnokey, gnodev...), I contributed as I could by giving feedbacks, discussing some ideas and difficulties I faced. I loved the team spirit and the communication with different members of the core team and other contributors. I learned a lot about the gno.land blockchain and the Gno language, but still thirsty for more.

### Your idea for fair funding of the proposal
I think a salary of â‚¬5,000 per month for a full-time position as a beginner is a fair funding, regarding the market salaries. This request is based on my experience during the internship in the gnoland ecosystem.

### What do you and the submission bring to the Gno.land platform and community?
As a team, with the other guys of Rouen students, the [GnoPool](https://hackmd.io/JRatkf0wQ_uYB5G2wNvRRw) Boot Camp will offer essential learning support for the newcomers, helping new developers learn the gno language and start building contracts on Gno.land. I addition to that, My personal project, GnoFundMe will demonstrate some faces of the gno language, and the gnoland blockchain. I will try to dive more into the core code, and look regularly into the issues to try to help solve problems, bring solutions, and think about other packages/realms I can add to gnoland that can benefit for the project.
