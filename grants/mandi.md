## Mandi: the Global Marketplace for Physical Goods

Based on my learnings from implementing Farmers' Marketplace on private Ethereum network, which I have summarized in my [blockchain marketplace whitepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16sgjimjbnBuRIfM6hsqM_-ywOwrj240L7tB31MZL1qo/edit#heading=h.oc04iae3914t), my idea is to iterate based on Gno Land blockchain.

*Mandi* (marketplace in Hindi), will have following features:
- [KYC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer) for compliance.
- [CBDC](https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/fintech/central-bank-digital-currency/virtual-handbook)
- Delegated Keys as well as self owned wallet.
- Multisig support for the marketplace administrator
- Fund escrow.
- Dispute resolution
- Whitelisting of Product Specification.
- Operates on single ERC20 (the base currency).

### Current Status
There are three core contracts for implementing the marketplace:
Presently coded in Solidity.

- CBDC (ERC20)
- Currency Exchange
- Marketplace contract

## The Proposal
To implement, that is to port the three solidity contracts to Gno. Also, provide test suite for the three products.

The marketplace will operate on a single base currency (CBDC) and works in conjunction with the currency exchange for cross border transactions.

Any marketplace operator wishing to deploy a distributed global marketplace should BYOL (Bring Your Own License).

### The Goal
The goal is to enable any global B2B distributed marketplace.
