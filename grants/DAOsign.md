# The title of your grant submission
DAOsign - Workflow Management Platform built with a Decentralized Smart Signature protocol

# Grant type (from examples in Readme)- tinker, builder, researcher: 
Builder

# A short description of what you are proposing (applies to all submissions): 

DAOsign offers a decentralized and customizable platform where collaboration, authorization, and workflow management are facilitated through cryptographic proofs stored on a blockchain

The Decentralized Smart Signature protocol serves as the cornerstone technology of DAOsign, encompassing a comprehensive system of cryptographic proofs, including identity, authority, signature, and agreement.

With Smart Signature, users gain access to a secure and customizable workflow management system. It also allows for control over team authorities and the ability to verify the signet’s identity.

What is the goal or the purpose of the proposed grant? (applies to all submissions):

We offer to build an advanced workflow management platform tailored to the needs of Gno.land developers and teams, with features such as task tracking and collaboration tools. This Workflow Management platform will be fully customizable per Gno.land needs, with configurable workspace and workflow steps. Such a platform will serve as a web3 backoffice of the important tasks within the Gnoland Ecosystem and will be upon Gnoland own domain and label.

# Contributions, issues and pull requests made to Gno and Game of Realms (links please):

We didn’t have a chance to contribute to Gno.land Ecosystem yet, but would appreciate such opportunity of working together.

# Why are you best suited/what is your background?:

We’ve been on the market since 2016 and during this time we contributed to almost all Tier1 blockchains, build more than a 40 projects and we would love to build something unique specifically for the Gno.land. Please see our teams background:

# Milestones and overall time frame of your proposal:

Gnolang Project Management software implementation

# Your idea for fair funding of the proposal:
$30 000, but the amount is nogotiable and depends on components needed for such software

# What do you and the submission bring to the Gno.land platform and community?:

We are applying for a grant to develop advanced project management software for Gno.land developers and teams. This software will include features such as task tracking, collaboration tools, and integrated Gno.land services. With the help of the DAOsign Workflow Orchestration component, we aim to build a platform specifically designed for the Gno.land ecosystem. This platform will streamline and simplify all tasks, workflows, and processes, as well as governance securely and transparently. Automating workflows can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. Our goal with DAOsign and our proposal is to make this process easier for you.
