## The title of your grant submission (how do you want us to remember you ðŸ˜Š)
*Thox*

## A short description of what you are proposing (applies to all submissions)
The grant will focus on the development of the Gno.land ecosystem and the creation of new packages and I would like to contribute in GnoVM and Infra/Ops.
And with rouen team, we want to work in the project called [GnoPool](https://hackmd.io/JRatkf0wQ_uYB5G2wNvRRw).

## What is the goal or the purpose of the proposed grant? (applies to all submissions)
The aim of this grant is to enable me to share `Gno` with everyone through `Gnopool`. And to continue to allow me to devote my free time to `Gno` to work on developing the ecosystem.

## Contributions, issues and pull requests made to Gno and Game of Realms (links please)
During this internship, I started by exploring the [documentation](https://docs.gno.land/) of Gno.land, which led me to make my first PRs: [1722](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/pull/1722) | [2246](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/pull/2246), and issues: [1755](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/issues/1755) | [1792](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/issues/1792). To continue my learning, I tested the implementation of new functions in the [todolist](https://github.com/DIGIX666/gno/tree/theo/examples/other_todo) and created a `Library book` [package](https://github.com/DIGIX666/gno/tree/theo/examples/gno.land/p/demo/library) and [realm](https://github.com/DIGIX666/gno/tree/theo/examples/gno.land/r/demo/library) to test my understanding of the language.
Subsequently, I contributed to Memeland because the project is cool, and I wanted to see if any issues needed addressing. Thus, I proposed 3 PRs: [21](https://github.com/gnolang/memeland/pull/21) | [22](https://github.com/gnolang/memeland/pull/22) | [24](https://github.com/gnolang/memeland/pull/24).

While examining the non-existent packages on Gno, I ventured into creating the `UUID` [package](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/pull/2076), a web2 standard that will enable compatibility between systems in web3. This package proposal led me to create an [issue](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/issues/2364) with Zak because I encountered a problem with value randomization, which is not possible without Oracle.

In the meantime, I also took an interest in existing ERCs on the Ethereum blockchain and noticed that Gno lacked an implemented GRC165. After some research, I created an [issue](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/issues/2086) to express my opinion on whether it would be relevant to have a GRC165 in Gno.

In my latest contributions, Zak, Muss, and I proposed two packages, [AccessControl and Timelock](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/pull/2307), which we believe will be a real asset to Gno.

## Why are you best suited/what is your background for the team to review your profile
Actully, I'm at the end of my studies as a developer with 2 years of training and 7 months of apprenticeship as a full stack developer, I have acquired knowledge in `GO, PHP, TS, and Docker`. This has allowed me to develop my way of learning new stacks, and thanks to the `Student Contributor` internship, it has increased my desire to continue contributing to the `Gno.land` project.

## Your idea for fair funding of the proposal
Based on the salary data on the web3 jobs website. I am asking for a remuneration of 5kâ‚¬/month. My request is based on the average salary of a Junior Blockchain Developer in Remote.

## What do you and the submission bring to the Gno.land platform and community?
My aim is to continue making progress in blockchain and I think Gnoland is an important and interesting project, so it's very rewarding to be able to contribute to it. 
What's more, it's based on a language that I like, which is Go, so that's really cool. My goal is to help build the project with my contributions and also to propose with the Rouen team a way accessible to all to learn and understand Gno
