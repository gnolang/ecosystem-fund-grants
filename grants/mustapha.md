mous1985 Contributor

### A short description of what you are proposing (applies to all submissions)
I propose to contribute to the evolution of Gno by developing essential Realms and packages for the ecosystem, specializing in everything related to data structures. Additionally, I aim to develop a [GnoPool](https://hackmd.io/JRatkf0wQ_uYB5G2wNvRRw) BootCamp in collaboration with the teams in Rouen to enable as many people as possible to learn Gno quickly and efficiently. I also plan to bring in new talents from Africa to further enrich our contributions.

### What is the goal or the purpose of the proposed grant? (applies to all submissions)
The purpose of this grant is to enable me to dedicate my full time to Gno, contributing to its rapid development. Additionally, it will support other developers in learning Gno through the GnoPool BootCamp.

### Contributions, issues and pull requests made to Gno and Game of Realms (links please)
**PRs :** 
 Open ([2265](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/pull/2265) | [2307](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/pull/2307))
- **Auction Dapp (MAZAD):**
    The project aims to develop a decentralized auction application (DApp) using GnoLang, named MAZAD (meaning "auction" in Arabic). 
    This application allows users to create and manage auctions, place bids, The [package auction](https://github.com/mous1985/gno/tree/auctionwithnft/examples/gno.land/p/demo/auction) contains the core logic and data structures for the auction functionality, while the [Realm auction](https://github.com/mous1985/gno/tree/auctionwithnft/examples/gno.land/p/demo/auction) manages the state   and routing for interacting with the auctions.here's an[ illustrative flow chart ](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVK4Dd0Hc=/)
    The next step is to integrate a jsclients part for the front-end
- **Community Engagement:**
    * Organized an open-source conference with Manfred at Zone01.
    * Effectively brought people together and showcased our exciting work by discussing our student program and Gnoland with potential contributors through organized events.
### Why are you best suited/what is your background for the team to review your profile
I hold a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering, driven by a passion for theoretical analysis, mathematics, and problem-solving. I prefer the traditional approach of designing solutions using a pen and notebook.
During my time here, I have actively applied my knowledge and strived to learn as much as possible about the gno.land blockchain and the Gno language.

### Your idea for fair funding of the proposal
I am requesting a salary of â‚¬5,000 per month for a full-time position. This request is based on my initial professional experience in the fields of blockchain and web3.

### What do you and the submission bring to the Gno.land platform and community?
My goal is to create packages and realms, develop dapps, and promote Gno to attract potential contributors, thereby driving the evolution of Gno.land. Additionally, the [GnoPool](https://hackmd.io/JRatkf0wQ_uYB5G2wNvRRw) BootCamp I plan to develop with the Rouen team will offer essential learning support for the community, helping new developers start building contracts on Gno.land.
