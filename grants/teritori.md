### Teritori Introduction

We're building an all-in-one Social OS for human organisations.
In the future, Gno would be the backbone of the OS, allowing to enforce transparency, security, meritocracy and fairness for users, builders, contributors, and communities to cooperate.

## What is the goal or the purpose of the proposed grant? (applies to all submissions)

Gno Grants would be used to:
- Cover our gnoland development team 
- Hire at least 1 new Golang Expert to join us, dedicated to Teritori x Gno DevRel and usability of our works for gno ecosystem.

Teritori OS can be both used as a demonstration of our gnolang contributions, but also as demonstration app for Gnoland ecosystem to highlight gnolang based products and gather all functionalities of the Gnoland ecosystem into a single app. By providing both modules and an alternative user interface for Gnoland users, Teritori core team want to onboard both mainstream users and developers into Gnoland ecosystem.

Teritori Core team is 100% self-funded, with no VC, no ICO, and no external funding from day #1 (except last Gno Grants for GnoDAO standards/deployer, and GnoProject Manager). 
Team goal is to reach self-sustainability with a fair and transparent ecosystem model 1 year maximum after Gnoland mainnet, by providing useful features for individuals, community and humans organisations, using Gnolang as backbone to build an agnostic and modular experience.

## Why are you best suited/what is your background (or teamâ€™s if applicable) (applies to all submissions)?
- Our team is composed of international engineers with strong blockchain backgrounds, who are passionate about the future of human organizations. These team members are focused on the target to build future-proof tools fitting with both individuals and organizations needs.
- Our team is distributed in several countries and our goal is to become one of the most active Gno DAO in the future, building full-time for the ecosystem, both for building tools for other developers and building products for main stream audience to use gno everyday.
- Our members are committed to continuously improve our Teritori product, but also to maintain and improve the developer experience to onboard more developers.
- The Teritori OS user experience will allow our team to progressively embed all Gnoland ecosystem dApps to provide an all-in-one experience for mainstream users to discover easily the Gno ecosystem in a single place, on web, desktop, and mobile.


## Milestones and overall time frame of your proposal
Milestones are set at a time frame of 6 months.

### Milestone #1 : Integrate into Portal loop (Gno Centrics mode)
#### Make our existing & future Modules more Gnocentrics
- [ ] Kill teritori-gno network and move to portal loop, adapt realms and packages if needed, redeploy and use portal loop as default gno network on teritori UI
- [ ] Work towards merging our existing packages and realms on gno repo, make atomics PRs if needed, address reviews promptly, etc..
- [ ] Update and maintain our realms and packages to be used on portal loop
- [ ] Refactor existing code to use seqid instead of custom ids
- [ ] Contribute to gnoweb to unlock more advanced UI in gnoweb so users don't need to use teritori dapp (if gno core team wants that)
- [ ] Show the value of our Gno code out of the UI
    - demo modules value with articles (ie: article about Portal loop by default on Teritori)
- [ ] Teritori team would now start contributing to more peer reviews
    - We need to improve our team engagement in 
        - gno core reviews
        - general bug fixes
        - documentation

---

### Milestone #2 : Bootstrap WorxDAO

- [ ] Define worxdao interfaces used to provide data about an user to the worxdao (contributions, scores, user-defined, etc..)
- [ ] Create a worxdao data-providers registry, permissioned with a single admin address first
- [ ] Create demo worxdao data-providers, user-defined profile, mock evaluation-dao, mock support-dao, etc..
- [ ] Allow to link a GitHub account with an address on-chain (or contribute with gno core mates on it)
Based on this Contributor Profile approach examples:
:link: https://github.com/gnolang/game-of-realms/tree/main/contributors/moul
:link: https://github.com/gnolang/game-of-realms/issues/10
- [ ] Fill gno user profile on Teritori UI with worxdao data (linkedin-like ux)
- [ ] Create a gnoweb-targeted Render() with worxdao data for an user (something like /r/worxcontributor:<addr>)
- [ ] Write documentation for the gno code (architecture overview, how to create a new data-provider, etc..)
- [ ] Build a Gno WorxDAO Leaderboard 
    - with accurate indexers and UI
        - for last weeks, months, etc.
        - rising stars, etc.
        - leaving contributors
    - allowing to see most important contributors and associated metrics
- [ ] Build a Gno WorxDAO 'Admin' Dashboard 
    - allowing to administrate and review WorxDAO data-providers
    
#### User Interfaces Examples: Gno Profiles (v0.1 Draft - will be adapted) :

### Your idea for fair funding of the proposal
- Our total grant request is of $390,000 USD corresponding to : 
    - $65,000 USD by month during 6 months
- We suggest a monthly upfront payment allowing to hire safely and have a simple follow-up based on a monthly report, from the end of February 2024 to end of August 2024. 
- Dog-fooding: we suggest to experiment our Gno Project Manager to display informations to the all community easily and have a transparent project overview using the onchain Kanban, as soon as possible.
