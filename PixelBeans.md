### Why are you best suited/what is your background?
We are a group of passionate young individuals with a strong interest in blockchain. United by our shared passion, we have come together to develop our first product â€“ a unique and innovative project not yet seen in the market. Currently, we are fully committed to turning our vision into reality. We are seeking a grant from Gno to bring this project to life, using PixelBeans as a cornerstone to further materialize our ideas and bring more vitality to Gno.

Our vision is to create an unparalleled blockchain creativity through this innovative and experimental NFT project, building a unique and dynamic digital world for all participants.
