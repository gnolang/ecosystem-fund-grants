# Advanced Security Team

The following has been requested:

"Enhance Gno.land security by conducting regular vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and implementing best practices for secure smart contract development."

As we are able to handle the entirety of this and more - I will keep this submission concise and straight to the point.

## Action list
1. Assemble team of advanced security operators; some with decades of experience.
2. OPSEC/SOCIAL ENGINEERING/PHISHING training and live tests against employees if needed.
3. Consistently pen test gno.land, gnolang and other web/software properties as needed.
4. Server hardening.
6. Help patch vulnerabilities by priority level ranking.
7. Score risk and vulnerabilities priority level based on potential resulting damage.
8. Testing Tendermint/RPC/API endpoints and node security.
9. Study and pen test gnolang for common and potentially critical new attacks.
10. General consistent offensive/defensive security operations as needed.

## Team
We are able to assemble a team (or even work as a 2 person team) filled with sophisticated cybersecurity actors. It depends on the requested scale of the team. The founding members of said security team would consist of myself: https://github.com/visualbasic6 and https://github.com/netr. We're both 20 to 25 years deep into programming, cybersec and being serial Internet entrepreneurs with an uncommon multitude of technical abilities - e.g. my Slack RCE, 75+ blockchain bugs including in Bitcoin Core, Tendermint, etc.

## Conclusion
We are able to conduct sophisticated hacking/programming operations to harden the ecosystem in an evolving landscape. We are quite confident in covering each item listed and others if needed.
